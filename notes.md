## Ideas

1. Automated Station (easy)
	- Rotating bed that redirects trains from track to track.

2. Multi-layer train elevator (medium)
	- Raises and lowers a single section of track in order to move a train from
	  track level to level. 
	  	- 2 or 3 levels total.
		- Use pneumatic pistons
		- Once on the correct level, trains can do some task or just go.

3. Train locator (medium / hard)
	- Track trains using accelerometer and maybe camera...?
	- Have computer program (actual computer) that can visualize train
	  positions.

4. POV trains (hard)
	- Attach camera to trains and collect camera views on screen.
